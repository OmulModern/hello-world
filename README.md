# hello-world
My first github repository

Hello my fellow humans!

I call myself 'OmulModern' which in english translation is 'theModernHuman'.
I am a self taught multidisciplinary working to learn to code, to better myself and the rest of humanity.
I support The Venus Project founded by the extraordinary mind of Jacque Fresco. I sometimes call him 'The Father of Humanity', 'The Modern Day Buddha'.

I strongly believe that we humans need to implement on this planet as quickly as possible a new socio-economic system that works for everyone everywhere and that's gonna allow each one of us to live a happy and fulffiled life. This new socio-economic system envisioned by Jacque Fresco its called a Resource Based Economy. If you read this, please research what I meantioned so far.

I also wish that the whole world becomes Vegan because that is the best thing for each and everyone of us, the animals, and the planet itself.

I love you all!
