This is my first github repository

Hello my fellow humans!

I call myself 'OmulModern' which in english translation is 'theModernHuman'.
I am a self taught multidisciplinary working to learn to code, to better myself and the rest of humanity.

I support The Venus Project founded by the extraordinary mind of Jacque Fresco. I sometimes call him 'The Father of Humanity', 'The Modern Day Buddha'.

I strongly believe that we humans need to implement on this planet as quickly as possible a new socio-economic system that works for everyone everywhere and that's gonna allow each one of us to live a happy and fulffiled life. This new socio-economic system envisioned by Jacque Fresco its called a Resource Based Economy and it will ged the world rid of wars, scarcity, homelesness, deprivation, unnecessary suffering and so much more.
If you read this, please research Jacque Fresco, The Venus Project and a Resource Based Economy .

I also wish that the whole world someday will become Vegan because I believe that is the best possible thing to happen for each and everyone of us, for our health and logevity, for the animals and the planet itself.

I love you all!
